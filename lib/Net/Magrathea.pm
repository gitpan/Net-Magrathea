=head1 NAME

Net::Magrathea - Perl interface to the Magrathea Telecom NTS API


=head1 VERSION

This document describes Net::Magrathea version 0.01


=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use strict;
    use warnings;
    use Net::Magrathea;
    
    my $ntsapi = Net::Magrathea->new(
        username => 'user',
        password => 'pass',
        debug    => 1,
    );
    
    my $index = 1;
    my $dest  = 'S:01224279484@sip.surevoip.co.uk';
    
    my $number = $ntsapi->allocate('01224______');
    
    $ntsapi->activate($number) if $ntsapi->success;
    
    $ntsapi->set( $number, $index, $dest ) if $ntsapi->success;
    
    $ntsapi->status($number) if $ntsapi->success;
    
    $ntsapi->user_info(
        $number, 'Suretec Systems Ltd., 24 Cormack Park,
        Rothienorman, Inverurie, AB51 8GL.'
    ) if $ntsapi->success;
    
    $ntsapi->deactivate($number) if $ntsapi->success;
    $ntsapi->quit;
  
  
=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides a Perl interface allowing you to connect 
to and operate the Magrathea Telecom 'Number Translation Service' API.



=head1 INTERFACE 

=head2 quit

Terminates the session. Should be called after the final command.

    $ntsapi->quit;

=head2 allocate

Attempt to allocate a phone number. The <number> can either be an entire
number, or may include underscores, to indicate any digit is acceptable.
This is the only command that accepts underscores as part of the <number>
parameter (now B<allocate_ten> also accepts underscores).

NOTE: This command does NOT reserve the number – you must issue an immediate
B<activate> command to ensure the number is allocated to your account and not 
available for allocation by others.

    $ntsapi->allocate('01224______');

Returns an allocated number.


=head2 activate

Activates a number obtained using the B<allocate> command. This command must
be used to finalise the reservation process.

    $ntsapi->allocate($number);

Result available via 

    my $message = $ntsapi->result;


=head2 deactivate

Deactivate the specified number. The number will no longer operate when
dialled.

The exact number must be entered; underscores are not permitted when using
this command.

NOTE: If you deactivate a number it becomes available for others to allocate, so
it cannot be guaranteed that you will be able to retrieve the number at a later
date

    $ntsapi->deactivate($number);

Result available via 

    my $message = $ntsapi->result;


=head2 reactivate

Reactivates a number that has previously been deactivated using the DEAC
command (if it has not since been allocated by someone else).

    $ntsapi->reactivate($number);

Result available via 

    my $message = $ntsapi->result;


=head2 status

Query the current status of the specified number. A successful reply contains
the information about the number’s current settings.

    $ntsapi->status($number);

Result available via 

    my $message = $ntsapi->result;

=head2 set

This command sets up destination for when the number is dialled.

    my $index = 1;
    my $dest  = 'S:01224279484@sip.surevoip.co.uk';

    $ntsapi->set( $number, $index, $dest ) if $ntsapi->success;

See the full NTS API docs for complete information (more than two pages).

=head2 user_info

This command has been added to enable storage of information about the user
of the number.

    $ntsapi->user_info(
        $number, 'Suretec Systems Ltd., 24 Cormack Park, Rothienorman, 
                  Inverurie, AB51 8GL.'
        if $ntsapi->success;

=head2 feature

The FEAT command can be used to check, enable or disable a particular
feature for an account.

NOTE: Not supported yet.


=head2 secure_pin

Set a PIN for the number.

NOTE: Not supported yet.


=head2 time_of_day_route

This command sets the destination usage by time of day, allowing (for
advanced NTS only) multiple targets to be setup and configuration when each
target is active.

NOTE: Not supported yet.


=head2 allocate_ten

This command has been provided to help locate ranges of ten numbers that are
available for allocation. The syntax of the <number> parameter is identical to
that of ALLO and the system will attempt to find a range of ten numbers (0
through to 9) that matches the passed <number> format.

NOTE: Not supported yet.


=head2 ported_numbers
 
NOTE: Not supported yet.
 
Control numbers that have been ported to Magrathea, if
your NTSAPI account has been given permission to do so.


=head2 errormsg

Retrieve the last message from the NTS API
 

=head1 DIAGNOSTICS

The last message from the Magrathea session can be retrieved via 
    
    print $ntsapi->errormsg

If you have set $ntsapi->debug(1) the session messages will be printed via
B<print>


=head1 CONFIGURATION AND ENVIRONMENT

Net::Magrathea requires no configuration files or environment variables.
